# NOTE
Dec 2019:  Recent versions of Qt5 are very broken on Gnome3 (especially on
Wayland), causing a number of significant UI bugs.  Unfortunately there
is nothing that can be done within Musikernel to fix this, but alternate
dektop environments like KDE have been tested and appear to work as intended.
